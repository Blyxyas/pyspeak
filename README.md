# PySpeak

PySpeak is a WIP project with the objective of porting the [Speak Rust Crate](https://github.com/speakml/speak) to Python, rewriting it completely in Python.

## To contributors
The project isn't documented yet (It has less than a week in public, though it should be fast.), so I recommend you to contribute in the [Rust version](https://github.com/speakml/speak). Though I created a pre-commit hook to add to your `.git/hooks` directory so all commits are locally checked
